                <article class="Content-Articles-List-Article-Item">Designed in 1938 and entering service in 1940, the KV-1 was designed to break through fixed defenses. It was equipped with a 76.2mm gun which could fire high explosive armor-piercing shells, a reliable diesel engine, and the toughest possible armor..</article>
                <article class="Content-Articles-List-Article-Item">The BT-7 entered service in 1935, having been developed from a specification set down in 1931. Its name stemmed from its role: “Bystrochodya Tank”, meaning “Fast Tank.”</article>
                <article class="Content-Articles-List-Article-Item">A light tank developed in the late 1920s, the MS was a replacement for the preceding KS. Lighter, shorter, and more reliable, it was produced in several variants. By the start of the war, the MS was no longer in frontline service. The last of them were modified to carry 47mm guns in 1941, in place of their 37mm weapons. But this was not enough to tackle the German Panzers, and the last MSs left service in 1942</article>
                <article class="Content-Articles-List-Article-Item">A Russian imitation of a British Vickers tank, the T-26 light tank entered mass production in 1932. It was one of the most successful inter-war Soviet tanks, thanks in part to a wide range of variants</article>
                <article class="Content-Articles-List-Article-Item">Again derived from a Vickers design, the T-28 medium tank entered production in 1933. With three turrets, one carrying a 76.2mm gun, it was a bulky machine. Despite this, it had decent speed and agility.</article>
                <article class="Content-Articles-List-Article-Item">A light amphibious tank, the T-40 joined reconnaissance units in 1941. A propeller and rudders let it cross rivers, the better to get about the war zone and find out what was happening. Equipped with only a machine-gun or 20mm gun, it was little use against other armor, and so of limited effectiveness in a standup fight.</article>
